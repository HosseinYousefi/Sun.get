[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HosseinYousefi/Sun.get.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HosseinYousefi/Sun.get)

# Exec Summary

You are not sure whether you can code without distraction? You want to have excuses to stay home and code? Use sun.get, a reliable and coder-savvy way to get the weather conditions.

## Source Data

After evaluation of various weather data APIs we took the decision to rely on the widely recommended Yahoo weather API. It’s depth of data, reliability, and update speed was the main argument for us to select this API.

## Availability

With two main operating systems being distributed, iOS and Android, we had to take a decision for our starting point. The decision was then made based on the spread of each operating system in the global smartphone market. Android, with its masisve global reach won.

## User Interface / Features

Sun.get will offer you an easy and fresh look to get the most critical information, i.e. temperature and climate condition, at first glance. [UI should be implemented]

The source data enables us to provide you information about:

- Location
- Wind
- Atmosphere
- Astronomy
- Condition
- Forecast

Especially, the forecast gives you the chance to plan not only the same day but also your upcoming weekend and potential trips and programs which need to be coded.
