[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HosseinYousefi/sun.get.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HosseinYousefi/sun.get)

# Exec Summary

You are not sure whether you can code without distraction? You want to have excuses to stay home and code? Use sun.get, a reliable and coder-savvy way to get the weather conditions.

## Source Data

After evaluation of various weather data APIs we took the decision to rely on the widely recommended Yahoo weather API. It’s depth of data, reliability, and update speed was the main argument for us to select this API.

## Availability

With two main operating systems being distributed, iOS and Android, we had to take a decision for our starting point. The decision was then made based on the spread of each operating system in the global smartphone market. Android5, with its global reach of 85% of the smartphone market won the race impressively.

## Functionality

The core functionality will be provided by a measurement interface enabling users to choose between Fahrenheit and Celsius also lets them select the metric or the imperial system.
The interface contains two methods, getMetric and getImperial.

## User Interface / Features

Sun.get will offer you an easy and fresh look to get the most critical information, i.e. temperature and climate condition, at first glance.

The source data enables us to provide you information about:

- Location
- Wind
- Atmosphere
- Astronomy
- Condition
- Forecast

Especially, the forecast gives you the chance to plan not only the same day but also your upcoming weekend and potential trips and programs which need to be coded.

Besides the general features, Sun.get provides:

 - Notifications every morning based on the GPS or your default location to structure your day more effectively.

 > e.g. if it is rainy: why don’t you stay home and accept a new code challenge?

- City overview in case you consider yourself a frequent traveler or generally an interested weather guru.
